## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
*“Anduril is a technology partner, not an equipment provider,” said Brian Schimpf. “Security threats are evolving faster than the DOD can keep pace. In order to really outmaneuver emerging threats we need to move past just efficiencies and create clear step changes in capability, quickly. Anduril has proven that that our model — recruiting talented engineers, building quickly and efficiently using venture dollars, and selling next-generation technology off the shelf to the government — works. And that with the right technology and incentives the government can be a nimble customer.”*

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
*U.S. Department of Defense; Allied Military Forces*

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
*Anduril's advantage/solution: Anduril aims to sell the U.S. Department of Defense technology that Silicon Valley firms have eschewed due to their controversial military applications, including artificial intelligence and robotics. "We identify problems, privately fund our R&D and sell finished products off the shelf. Ideas are turned into deployed capabilities in months, not years, saving the government and taxpayers money along the way."*
