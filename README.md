## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
*“Anduril is a technology partner, not an equipment provider,” said Brian Schimpf. “Security threats are evolving faster than the DOD can keep pace. In order to really outmaneuver emerging threats we need to move past just efficiencies and create clear step changes in capability, quickly. Anduril has proven that that our model — recruiting talented engineers, building quickly and efficiently using venture dollars, and selling next-generation technology off the shelf to the government — works. And that with the right technology and incentives the government can be a nimble customer.”* [^4]

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
U.S. Department of Defense; Allied Military Forces

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Anduril's advantage/solution: Anduril aims to sell the U.S. Department of Defense technology that Silicon Valley firms have eschewed due to their controversial military applications, including artificial intelligence and robotics. Products as such include an AI-controlled combat drone and an AI-enabled Autonomous Security Network. *[Anduril] identifies problems, privately fund[s] our R&D and sell finished products off the shelf. Ideas are turned into deployed capabilities in months, not years, saving the government and taxpayers money along the way."* [^5]

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Lattice OS is at the center of Anduril's product. It operates as their general commabd hub, using AI and computer vision to depict a view of the battlefield which can be interacted with using a computer, tablet, or VR headset. It streamlines decision-making and offers potential next moves for the user - an operating system for war. Lattice OS is supported by Anduril's proprietary software, Anduril Menace, *"an integrated, expeditionary, secure, command, control, communications, and computing (C4) platform."* [^6]

## Landscape

### What field is the company in?
Defense

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? 
Trends in this field have largely channeled toward incorporating autonomous systems and AI, a centralized focus on cybersecurity and warfare, and the development of advanced sensor technologies, such as radar systems and surveillance tools. In combination, these trends supports the industry's desire to enhance military capabilities via drones and AI decision-making systems, implement strategies to protect against cyber attacks, and improve situational awareness and intelligence gathering.[^7] [^8] 

## Results

### What are the other major companies in this field?
*Northrop Grumman, Shield AI, XTEND, REGENT Craft, Elbit Systems, Second Front Systems, Rebellion Defense, Cognitive Space.* [^9]

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
*"In the first twenty months after being founded, Anduril hit $10 million in revenue. Within four years, Anduril eclipsed $100 million in revenue. In 2021, the company was rumored to generated $150 million in revenue... Anduril’s traction can also be viewed from the perspective of winning government contracts. Within the first two years of operation, Anduril’s fast-paced shipment of complex products earned them roughly a dozen contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security in 2019. In 2020, Customs and Border Control awarded Anduril a contract worth $250 million."* [^10]

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Companies in this field can use a combination of financial and operational metrics to measure their success. Some metrics that are viable to these companies include: contract wins and backlog, meaning the value and the number of contracts gained by the company; research and development investment, how much a company invests in their R&D in order to maintain competition and spark innovation; profit margins; and laslty, production efficiency and a company's supply chain performance, these two metrics being important as they measure how quickly a defense company creates and ships their products and also how smoothly their supply chain inputs/partnership run.


### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Anduril has 419 competitors and currently ranks 2nd, per Tracxn. [^11]

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
As we experienced during the pandemic, supply chain issues can at worst cripple an economy and at best, create temporary delivery delays. But with rising geopolitical tensions, Anduril should consider defense solutions for their supply chain and their partnerships. They should seek to provide security solutions with any vendors or distributors in high-risk zones as well as seek to mitigate risks by creating viable alternatives regarding delivery routes and logistics. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
--- N/A

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The top three products and patents that they sell/hold pertain to diagrams, sensors, and digital photography. However, for Anduril to maintain their competitive edge they should invest in building a network of efficient shipping partners and they should establish a global infrastructure system that circumvents traditional shipping lanes/routes to maintain quick product delivery for their customers during crucial geopolitical conflicts and to avoid bottle necking.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
By providing a hyperfocus on their business logistics and preserving the transporation of their inputs and capital goods, Anduril can remain competitive through staying agile and being preemptive.
